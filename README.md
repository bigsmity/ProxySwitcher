# ProxySwitcher
Automatically change your windows proxy settings based on the network you are connected to.

This functionality should be built into windows. It is not. Here is the functionality.

I found myself needing to change my proxy settings regularly when working on different networks. There are apps available to make this simpler, but these do not detect and change your proxy settings automatically. This is a must have for any IT contractor running a windows OS on their laptop. Built and tested on win 10 pro.

The network name is matched to your predefined settings and the proxy updated accordingly. This works for wired and wireless networks.
